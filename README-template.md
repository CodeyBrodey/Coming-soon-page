## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Got a chance to prove myself of being able to use some Javascript to make things work. In this case it was making a simple form validation. The CSS styling was also a challenge specifically the layout change in between the mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I need to continually get comfortable with Javascript to be able to make more complex and cleaner functions for sites.
